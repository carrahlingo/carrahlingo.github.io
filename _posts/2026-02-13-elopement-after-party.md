In March 2023, we eloped with our immediate family on Catalina Island. But we still wanted to party with our favorite people! So we threw an after party on our D.C. rooftop two months later. We sent an e-vite (White Lotus / California cocktail Pinterest board included), crossed our fingers, and hoped people would travel to our new home in D.C. for our nontraditional celebration. Spoiler alert: They did... and they looked good doing it. Here's how we pulled it off.

## Set the Vibe

We had a groovy California vibe to our party that matched my personal taste as well as the interior design of our rooftop lounge.

At our welcome table people could choose from a pair of retro sunglasses (I ordered the sunglasses and the tablecloth from Amazon).

I also had a goal of reducing waste, so I tried to order things that I could use later down the line. We still have some matchbooks in our bathroom today! We rented these cute coolers for all the beer, seltzers and non-alcoholic drinks. And the baskets were a gift from our West Elm wedding registry.

It was our first year living in D.C., and we thought it would be cool to share some of our favorite places with our friends. Grand Cata is a Latin American wine shop around the corner from our place, and we knew we wanted them pouring wine throughout the night.

## Feed Your Guests (and Yourself)

Shades on. Drinks poured. Let's go.

The rooftop filled up fast. It ended up pouring rain so we were all stuck inside together. Luckily we had great company and a vibey space to hang out in.

Polaroids, pizza, and wine — the millennial's holy trinity of a good time.

## Debut Your Wedding Video

At sunset we fired up the projector and screened our wedding video. This was the first time anyone got to see our video, and the sunset was a gorgeous backdrop for the viewing. Tears were shed, laughs were had, and it was so fun to share memories of our elopement with our friends and family.

## End with a Toast

Have your best friends say a few words. It doesn't have to be formal — just heartfelt. The energy in the room was unreal.

One big toast to close it out. To love, to rooftops, and to doing things your own way.
