## Why Not Just Use a Template?

<!-- Why you chose to go custom instead of Squarespace/Canva/Wix. What were you looking for that templates couldn't give you? What made you want to learn something deeper? -->

## What Is Claude Code?

<!-- Brief explainer for readers who don't know Claude. What it is, what it can do, why it's different from just Googling how to code. -->

## Step 1: Start with a Vision

<!-- What did you want your site to look and feel like? Mood board, inspiration, the shelf concept, etc. -->

## Step 2: Set Up the Basics

<!-- How you got the project started — GitHub Pages, Jekyll, the initial structure. What Claude helped with here. -->

## Step 3: Design It Your Way

<!-- The fun part — how you worked with Claude to build custom layouts, the Work/Play split, the shelf pages. How it felt like a creative collaboration vs. dragging and dropping. -->

## Step 4: Add Content and Make It Yours

<!-- Blog posts, photos, resume, podcast links. How easy it was to add and rearrange things once the structure was in place. -->

## Step 5: Launch It

<!-- Pushing live, custom domain, seeing it out in the world. -->

## What I Learned

<!-- The bigger takeaway — what you gained by choosing the harder path. New skills, understanding of how websites work, confidence with AI tools. -->

## Would I Recommend It?

<!-- Honest take — who is this approach for, who should stick with templates, and why you're glad you did it this way. -->
